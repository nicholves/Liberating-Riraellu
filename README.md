	Your goal is to liberate the island nations of Riraellu. To do this, you must fly around the map to find and destroy the various bases. 
	Once a base has all of its defenses destroyed, you can fly up to a base to do 1 of 3 things. Either increase your score, restore your HP or add a shield
        to yourself.
